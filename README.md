Covid-19 in Africa: The Big Picture

Waves of Infection:
Most African countries saw two major Covid-19 waves in 2021, one mid-year and another toward year-end, with the Delta variant playing a big role.

Different Countries, Different Stories:
South Africa, Nigeria, and Ethiopia had the highest numbers of new cases, but smaller countries sometimes faced higher rates compared to their populations, especially during peak months.

Not Evenly Spread:
Covid-19 hit different regions at different times. Southern and northern Africa often saw bigger and earlier spikes than the center of the continent.

Data Matters:
Differences in testing and reporting across countries mean that some case numbers may reflect more about testing capacity than actual spread.

What We Learned About South Africa

Vaccines Save Lives:
The data shows a clear trend: as more people got fully vaccinated, daily Covid-19 deaths dropped significantly, especially in the second half of 2021.

Not Always Simple:
There were still sudden increases in deaths, likely due to new variants or temporary surges, even after vaccinations ramped up.

Strong Evidence for Vaccination:
Correlation analysis confirms that increased vaccination is strongly linked to fewer deaths. The link between new cases and deaths is less direct, likely because of time lags or other factors.

Good Data = Good Insights:
Cleaning the data was crucial, removing errors or outliers made our findings more accurate.

Africa’s Overall Covid-19 Impact

Totals You Can Trust:
By using only the latest figures for each country, we calculated robust totals for cases and deaths, avoiding double-counting.

Case Fatality Rate:
Africa’s overall fatality rate was calculated as total deaths divided by total cases (using the latest reliable data), giving us a clearer sense of Covid-19’s impact on the continent.

In summary:
Vaccination made a real difference in reducing deaths in South Africa, but trends and outcomes varied widely across Africa due to different waves, health systems, and data quality. Careful data preparation helped us draw these insights and provided a more accurate picture of Covid-19’s effects.
